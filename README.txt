Readable JavaScript for Opera
=============

Extension for auto-formatting JavaScript code. 

Triggered by files with .js extension in their URL or by the toolbar button.

This extension supports optional syntax highlighting via Google's JS PrettyPrint
parser but it is very slow and sometimes hurts my eyes with strange guessing
so personally I don't recommend to enable it.

Based on the folowing projects:
