Readable JavaScript for Opera
=============

Extension for auto-formatting JavaScript code. 

It is triggered by clicking yellow popup which appears on top of a page
for files with .js extension in their URL or by the toolbar button.

This extension supports optional syntax highlighting based on Google's PrettyPrint
parser but it is very slow and sometimes hurts my eyes with strange guessing
so personally I don't recommend to enable it.

There is known speedwise incompatibility with scripts that actively and regardlessly
meddle with DOM processing. It can result impairment of highlighting performance to a great extent.
